Pre Generated Gerbers are currently on hold for public release. This is to allow fine tuning of the layout and to keep the sources of boards to just a few. The goal is to not flood the communiety with cheap boards. Several peolple have contributed to funding board runs from a very high qualiety fab and they are available for sale on the popular forums and facebook groups.

The boards seen here have been ordered from E-Teknet and had the 100% NetList test completed on them. https://www.e-teknet.com/
