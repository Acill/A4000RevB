Pre Generated Gerbers for public release. The goal is to not flood the communiety with cheap boards. Several peolple have contributed to funding board runs from a very high qualiety fab and they are available for sale on the popular forums and facebook groups. Its been asked that those generating boards respect the set price of $85. 

If you paid more than $85 for a board you are being over charged from someone that is reselling the bord they got from the offical current supplier!!

The boards seen here have been ordered from E-Teknet and had the 100% NetList test completed on them. https://www.e-teknet.com/


January 4th 2019: a4k-6x_pads_Jan2019 is a new complete version to send in for manufacturing boards. The previous version works fine but has an error that had solder mask over some of the ground pads for the DB9 mouse and jotytick ports bracket. Use this file for all future boards. The original is left here for historical tracking.
