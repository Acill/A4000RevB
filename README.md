READ THIS: New board files and gerbers have been created and posted to the Github project page. A minor error was discovered that had solder mask covering the ground pads for the support bracket on the mouse and joystick ports. Previous boards work just fine and are not in danger of not working. This is more of a cosmetic update than anything else. Get the new file in the Gerber folder. When using the Chinese sites like JLPCB and PCBway you will need to upload the complete zip gerber archive and email them about the board design. It is done in Mentor PADs. This is a professional layout and it will not usually work with the automatic software they use. I have produced these here in the US and have no problems. Others have used JLPCB with no problems as well. I f you would like a single board and need help I can order sets of 5 and would be happy to sell you one. You can email me through the contact page or directly at info@acill.com and request one. Currently they run $85 shipped in the USA and $100 international.
