# A4000 Replica Project (Based on the Rev B)
Amiga 4000 Replica project. Based on the A4000 Rev B and funded by Paul Rezendes and the generous contributions of the Amiga Community. 

The FINAL review is done and checks out. I have uploaded the new file in the layout folder at git hub. Also uploaded is a zip with Additional outputs included.  These have been translated from the original PADS database so use them at your own risk.
The Altium file looks good. Supposedly Eagle will import an Accel ASCII database but my first try was not successful.  The file does not look correct. Worst case, those that know what to do can import the Gerber and recreate the database from it.  Eagle just does not have a good importer at this time. It will follow up with the fabrication documents and'pick and place' data.
