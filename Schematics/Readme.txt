This is the final schematic without the electrical comparison test.
I fix the flag problems and found a few other problems that I have also fixed.  I have very high confidence in the schematic and netlist at this time. 
Schematic matches the PDF which also now matches the PCB.  There were some errors in the provided PCB.
There are 3 nets which are not connected, IO_CH_RDY, _LDS and _UDS.

I did not make any changes from the original design such as tying the unused logic gate inputs to ground.

FYI, this is a 4 layer board with mixed signal / planes for the inner layers.  They originally used the internal layers to make some of the signal connections in addition to power and ground planes.

Viewing requires Mentor Graphics PADS or the PADS free viewer! Final versions will be posted once the review is complete. 
THIS IS NOT A FEATURE REQUEST REVIEW! This is only to finalize the schematic for final board layout.
